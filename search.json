    "text": "R and RStudio\nPlease ensure that you have the latest versions of R and RStudio installed prior to the first session. Currently, that’s R-4.4.0 and RStudio-2024.04.1.\nWe also strongly recommend all participants to install the development tools to avoid potential issues installing packages.\n\nInstalling R\nDownload the pre-compiled binary for your OS from https://cloud.r-project.org/ and install. More specifically:\nFor Windows\nClick “Download R for Windows”, then “base”, then “Download R-4.4.0 for Windows”. This will download an .exe file; once downloaded, open to start the installation.\nFor Mac\nClick “Download R for macOS”, then “R-4.4.0-arm64.pkg” (the first option) to download the installer for Macs with Apple Silicon chips or “R-4.4.0-x86_64.pkg” (the second option) to download the installer for Macs with Intel chips. Run the installer to complete installation.\nFor Linux\nClick “Download R for Linux”. Instructions on installing are given for Debian, Fedora, Redhat, Suse and Ubuntu distributions. Where there is a choice, install both r-base and r-base-dev.\n\n\nInstalling R Studio Desktop (Open Source Edition)\nDownloads are available from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nDownload the relevant installer either under the “Install RStudio” header or, scrolling down the page, from the ‘All installers and Tarballs’ section. Run the installer to complete installation.\nFor Windows with no admin rights\nDownload the .zip source archive under “Zip/Tarballs”. Extract the files to a folder where you have write access, e.g. C:\\Users\\username\\RStudio. In this folder, open the bin directory and find the RStudio program: it is named rstudio.exe, but the file extension will typically be hidden, so look for rstudio. Right-click this executable to create a desktop shortcut. Double-click the executable or use the shortcut to open.\nFor all other operating systems\nDownload the relevant installer for your OS listed under “Installers for Supported Platforms”. Run the installer to complete installation.\n\n\nDevelopment Tools\nSome additional tools may be required to compile R packages from source.\nFor Windows with no admin rights\nDownload the latest (recommended) Rtools installer, Rtools.exe, from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/. Run the installer keeping the default settings.\nFor Windows with admin rights\nDownload the latest Rtools installer, Rtools.exe, from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/. Run the installer making the following selections: keep the default settings for the installation location and components to install; check the box to add rtools to the system PATH.\nFor Mac\nInstall XCode. Either:\n\nDownload and install XCode from the Mac AppStore: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12\nWithin XCode go to Preferences : Downloads and install the Command Line Tools\n\nOr for a smaller download size:\n\nRegister as an Apple Developer (free) here: https://developer.apple.com/programs/register/\nDownload the Command Line Tools for XCode appropriate for the version of OS X you are running from here: https://developer.apple.com/downloads/\n\nFor Linux\nIf you installed r-base-dev, when installing R, you should have all you need to build packages from source. Otherwise return to the instructions for installing R for your distribution and follow the instructions there to install the additional tools."
